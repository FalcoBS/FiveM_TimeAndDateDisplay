# FiveM_TimeAndDateDisplay
This script displays the time and date in the upper right or left corner of the screen and also shows the day of the week. You can also turn off the parts you do not want to display. 
I just made some changes to the code of https://github.com/TheRealKymac/FiveM_TimeAndDateDisplay to allow better control and improve performance.

v0.1 Optimized version release
